

1.  **Created a New Branch (`nav-branch`) and Committed Changes**
    
    -   You switched to `nav-branch` and committed the "added navbar" change.
2.  **Switched Back to `new-branch` and Made Changes**
    
    -   You switched back to `new-branch` and committed "changed the content of the main branch."
3.  **Pushed Changes to Remote**
    
    -   You pushed `main`, `new-branch`, and `nav-branch` to GitHub.
4.  **Attempted to Rebase Using an Incorrect Command**
    
    -   `git rebase -1 HEAD~1` was incorrect because `-1` is not a valid option.
5.  **Used Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i HEAD~1`)**
    
    -   This allowed you to amend the commit.
6.  **Encountered a Stuck Rebase**
    
    -   You tried running `git rebase -i HEAD~1` multiple times, but Git detected an ongoing rebase.
    -   The error suggested using `git rebase --continue`, `git rebase --abort`, or `git rebase --skip`.
7.  **Aborted the Rebase (`git rebase --abort`)**
    
    -   This reset everything back to the last stable state.
8.  **Successfully Rebasing Again**
    
    -   After aborting, you re-ran `git rebase -i HEAD~1` and modified the commit.
9.  **Forced Pushed to Remote (`git push --force origin new-branch`)**
    
    -   Since a rebase rewrites history, a force push was needed to update the remote branch.
